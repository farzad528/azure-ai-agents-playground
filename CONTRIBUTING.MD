# Contributing to Azure AI Agents Playground

Welcome to the Azure AI Agents Playground! This is your space to explore, learn, and build amazing things with Azure AI Agents. Whether you're interested in tutorials, Jupyter Notebooks, or full-stack applications, your contributions are highly encouraged and appreciated!

This project is designed to be a personal playground for [Farzad528](https://github.com/farzad528), but open to the community for learning and inspiration. While direct contributions via Pull Requests might not always be merged directly, your suggestions, bug reports, and ideas are invaluable for shaping the direction of this repository.

Most contributions to Microsoft-related projects require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit [https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
