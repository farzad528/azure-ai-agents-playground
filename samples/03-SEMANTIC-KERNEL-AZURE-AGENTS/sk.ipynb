    "This project connects to Azure AI Search using **System-Assigned Managed Identity** rather than API keys. Follow these steps to configure the necessary permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- An Azure AI Search service (e.g., \"fsunavala-ai-search\")\n",
    "- An Azure AI Foundry project with System-Assigned Managed Identity enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Role Assignments\n",
    "For your Azure AI Foundry project to access Azure AI Search, you must assign two roles to your project's managed identity:\n",
    "1. **Search Service Contributor** - Allows management of the search service\n",
    "2. **Search Index Data Reader** - Allows reading data from search indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open your Azure AI Search service in the Azure Portal**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to Access Control (IAM)**\n",
    "   - Select \"Add role assignment\" from the top menu\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign the Search Service Contributor role**\n",
    "   - In the \"Role\" tab, search for and select \"Search Service Contributor\"\n",
    "   - Click \"Next\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Select Managed Identity as the assignment type**\n",
    "   - In the \"Members\" tab, select \"Managed Identity\"\n",
    "   - Click \"Select members\"\n",
    "   - Choose \"System-assigned managed identity\" from the \"Managed identity\" dropdown\n",
    "   - In the \"System-assigned managed identity\" section, select \"Azure AI Project\"\n",
    "   - Find and select your Azure AI Foundry project name\n",
    "   - Click \"Select\"\n",
    "   - Click \"Next\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Review and complete the assignment**\n",
    "   - Verify all information is correct\n",
    "   - Click \"Review + assign\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat steps 2-5 for the Search Index Data Reader role**\n",
    "   - Follow the same process but select \"Search Index Data Reader\" as the role\n",
    "\n",
    "Once completed, your Azure AI Foundry project's managed identity will have the necessary permissions to access your Azure AI Search service without requiring API keys."

      "ü§ñ In Azure AI Search, \"BQ\" refers to Binary Quantization. It is a technique used to compress high-dimensional vectors by representing each component as a single bit (0 or 1), significantly reducing the memory footprint and speeding up vector comparison operations. This method is particularly effective for embeddings that are centered around zero and with dimensions greater than 1024. By utilizing BQ, the size of vector indices can be reduced by up to 96%, which enhances performance in search and retrieval tasks„Äê3:0‚Ä†source„Äë.\n"
