Jocelyn was a precious 12 year old girl beloved by her family and friends for her kindness and infectious zeal for life. She loved animals and had a passion for ensuring that they had homes.

This industry plays a vital role in key downstream civilian industries, including construction. The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the wood supply chain from imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products being dumped onto the United States market.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The United States has ample timber resources. The current United States softwood lumber industry has the practical production capacity to supply 95 percent of the United States' 2024 softwood consumption. Yet, since 2016 the United States has been a net importer of lumber.</FP>\n                <FP>Wood products are a key input used by both the civilian construction industry and the military. Each year, the United States military spends over 10 billion dollars on construction. The military also invests in innovative building material technology, including processes to create innovative wood products such as cross-laminated timber. The procurement of these building materials depends on a strong domestic lumber industry and a manufacturing base capable of meeting both military-specific and wider civilian needs.</FP>\n                <FP>It is the policy of the United States to ensure reliable, secure, and resilient domestic supply chains of timber, lumber, and their derivative products.

Timber production is essential for crucial human activities like construction and energy production. Furthermore, as recent disasters demonstrate, forest management and wildfire risk reduction projects can save American lives and communities.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>The United States has an abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs, but heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of these resources and made us reliant on foreign producers. Our inability to fully exploit our domestic timber supply has impeded the creation of jobs and prosperity, contributed to wildfire disasters, degraded fish and wildlife habitats, increased the cost of construction and energy, and threatened our economic security. These onerous Federal policies have forced our Nation to rely upon imported lumber, thus exporting jobs and prosperity and compromising our self-reliance. It is vital that we reverse these policies and increase domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Directives to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture.</E>\n                     (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Chief of the United States Forest Service (USFS), respectively, shall each issue new or updated guidance regarding tools to facilitate increased timber production and sound forest management, reduce time to deliver timber, and decrease timber supply uncertainty, such as the Good Neighbor Authority described in 16 U.S.C. 2113a, stewardship contracting pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 6591c, and agreements or contracts with Indian tribes under the Tribal Forest Protection Act as contemplated by 25 U.S.C. 3115a.

Our Nation's historic governing documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, have all been written in English. It is therefore long past time that English is declared as the official language of the United States. A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream. Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society. This order recognizes and celebrates the long tradition of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it to their children for generations to come.</FP>\n                <FP>To promote unity, cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens, ensure consistency in government operations, and create a pathway to civic engagement, it is in America's best interest for the Federal Government to designate one\u00e2\u0080\u0094and only one\u00e2\u0080\u0094official language. Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society.</FP>\n                <FP>Accordingly, this order designates English as the official language of the United States.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions.</E>\n                     For purposes of this order:\n                </FP>\n                <P>(a) \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgency\u00e2\u0080\u009d has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, except that such term does not include the Executive Office of the President or any components thereof.</P>\n                <P>(b) \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgency Head\u00e2\u0080\u009d means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise specified in this order.</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Designating an Official Language for the United States.</E>\n                     (a) English is the official language of the United States.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) Executive Order 13166 of August 11, 2000 (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency), is hereby revoked; nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency.

For far too long, prices were hidden from patients and employers, with inadequate recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or procedure. These opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities, such as hospitals and insurance companies, to operate with insufficient accountability regarding their pricing practices, resulting in patients, employers, and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare costs.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>Pursuant to Executive Order 13877 of June 24, 2019 (Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First), my Administration issued paradigm-shifting regulations to put patients first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful price information to the American people. These regulations require hospitals to maintain a consumer-friendly display of pricing information for up to 300 shoppable services and a machine-readable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides; health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information.</FP>\n                <FP>One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025. Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. Recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term.</FP>\n                <FP>Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level has stalled since the end of my first term. Hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all. The Biden Administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration's requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs.</FP>\n                <FP>The American people deserve better. Making America healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices. By building on the historic efforts of my first term, my Administration will make more meaningful price information available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare system.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     It is the policy of the United States to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make well-informed \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"11006\"/>\n                    healthcare decisions.

Copper, scrap copper, and copper's derivative products play a vital role in defense applications, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, including clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics. The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain, with increasing reliance on foreign sources for mined, smelted, and refined copper.\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP>The United States has ample copper reserves, yet our smelting and refining capacity lags significantly behind global competitors. A single foreign producer dominates global copper smelting and refining, controlling over 50 percent of global smelting capacity and holding four of the top five largest refining facilities. This dominance, coupled with global overcapacity and a single producer's control of world supply chains, poses a direct threat to United States national security and economic stability.</FP>\n                    <FP>It is the policy of the United States to ensure a reliable, secure, and resilient domestic copper supply chain. The United States' increasing dependence on foreign sources of copper, particularly from a concentrated number of supplier nations, along with the risk of foreign market manipulation, necessitate action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of copper, scrap copper, and copper's derivative products threaten to impair national security.</FP>\n                    <FP>\n                        <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                        . \n                        <E T=\"03\">Investigation Into the National Security Impact of Copper Imports.</E>\n                         (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine the effects on national security of imports of copper in all forms, including but not limited to:\n                    </FP>\n                    <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) raw mined copper;</FP>\n                    <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) copper concentrates;</FP>\n                    <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(iii) refined copper;</FP>\n                    <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(iv) copper alloys;</FP>\n                    <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(v) scrap copper;

The plain text of Federal law, including the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) (PRWORA), generally prohibits illegal aliens from obtaining most taxpayer-funded benefits. Title IV of the PRWORA states that it is national policy that \u00e2\u0080\u009caliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[i]t is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in the decades since the passage of the PRWORA, numerous administrations have acted to undermine the principles and limitations directed by the Congress through that law. Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources. My Administration will uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans. \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Preserving Federal Public Benefits</E>\n                    .

The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws. Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties. In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President's ongoing supervision and control. The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people. This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>However, previous administrations have allowed so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cindependent regulatory agencies\u00e2\u0080\u009d to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.</FP>\n                <FP>These practices undermine such regulatory agencies' accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people's elected President.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials' accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the \n                    <E T=\"03\">Federal Register</E>\n                    . \n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions</E>\n                    .

American life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with pre-COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and comparable countries averaging 82.6 years. This equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for the United States population. Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases. An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>These realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe. Across 204 countries and territories, the United States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021, nearly double the next-highest rate. Further, from 1990-2021, the United States experienced an 88 percent increase in cancer, the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated. In 2021, asthma was more than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe, Asia, or Africa. Autism spectrum disorders had the highest prevalence in high-income countries, including the United States, in 2021. Similarly, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such as Europe and North America. Overall, the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action.</FP>\n                <FP>This concern applies urgently to America's children. In 2022, an estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease. Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the condition during the 1980s. Eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to 30 percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40 percent of adolescents are overweight or obese.</FP>\n                <FP>These health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication. For example, in the case of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4 million children are now on medication for the disorder\u00e2\u0080\u0094up from 3.2 million children in 2019-2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise. </FP>\n                <FP>This poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life. Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores. Ninety percent of the Nation's $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions. In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively. These trends harm us, our economy, and our security.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    To fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease. This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy \n                    <PRTPAGE P=\"9834\"/>\n                    lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety. We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data. We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy</E>\n                    . It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. To do so, executive departments and agencies (agencies) that address health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease. Under this policy: \n                </FP>\n                <P>(a) all federally funded health research should empower Americans through transparency and open-source data, and should avoid or eliminate conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust; </P>\n                <P>(b) the National Institutes of Health and other health-related research funded by the Federal Government should prioritize gold-standard research on the root causes of why Americans are getting sick; </P>\n                <P>(c) agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that United States food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world; and </P>\n                <P>(d) agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Establishment and Composition of the President's Make America Healthy Again Commission</E>\n                    .

Presidents rely on their Secretaries of State and their subordinate officials to ensure that the United States is served and protected at home and abroad. As the principal steward of the President's foreign policy, the Secretary must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to implement this policy effectively.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Policy.</E>\n                     All officers or employees charged with implementing the foreign policy of the United States must under Article II do so under the direction and authority of the President. Failure to faithfully implement the President's policy is grounds for professional discipline, including separation. The personnel procedures of executive departments and agencies (agencies) charged with implementing the President's foreign policy must therefore provide an effective and efficient means for ensuring that officers and employees faithfully implement the President's policies.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Definitions.</E>\n                     For the purposes of this order:\n                </FP>\n                <P>(a) the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cDepartment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cForeign Service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cService,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary\u00e2\u0080\u009d shall have the meaning given those terms by section 3902 of title 22, United States Code; and</P>\n                <P>(b) the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmembers of the Foreign Service\u00e2\u0080\u009d shall have the same meaning as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmembers of the Service\u00e2\u0080\u009d under section 3903 of title 22, United States Code.</P>\n                <P>(c) the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cCivil Service employee\u00e2\u0080\u009d shall mean an employee of the Department holding United States citizenship, except for a member of the Foreign Service, as defined in section 2664a of title 22, United States Code.</P>\n                <P>(d) the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cother staff\u00e2\u0080\u009d shall mean locally employed staff and agents under the authority of sections 202(a)(4)(A) (22 U.S.C. 3922(a)(4)(A)) and 303 (22 U.S.C. 3943) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, or special Government employees of the Department as defined in section 202(a) of title 18, United States Code.</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 4</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Election of Procedures.</E>\n                     When the Secretary concludes that a member of the Foreign Service, a Civil Service employee, or other staff has demonstrated performance or conduct that warrants a personnel action, the Secretary shall, with respect to officials appointed by the Secretary or others within the Department, take appropriate action, subject to the supervision of the President, and shall, with respect to officials appointed by the President, preliminarily determine whether to refer such a matter for the President's consideration.

Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration to eliminate, to the greatest extent permitted by law, executive departments and agencies and programs that do not directly benefit the American people or further our Nation's interests.\n                </FP>\n                <FP>In particular, the Federal Executive Institute, which was created by the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson more than 50 years ago, is a Government program purportedly designed to provide leadership training to bureaucrats. But bureaucratic leadership over the past half-century has led to Federal policies that enlarge and entrench the Washington, DC, managerial class, a development that has not benefited the American family. The Federal Executive Institute should therefore be eliminated to refocus Government on serving taxpayers, competence, and dedication to our Constitution, rather than serving the Federal bureaucracy.</FP>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 2</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">Elimination of the Federal Executive Institute.</E>\n                     (a) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall take all necessary steps to eliminate the Federal Executive Institute, in accordance with applicable law.\n                </FP>\n                <P>(b) All prior Presidential or other executive branch documents establishing or requiring the existence of the Federal Executive Institute, including the Presidential Memorandum of May 9, 1968, regarding the Federal Executive Institute, and any applicable provisions of Executive Order 11348 of April 20, 1967 (Providing for the Further Training of Government Employees), are hereby revoked.</P>\n                <FP>\n                    <E T=\"04\">Sec. 3</E>\n                    . \n                    <E T=\"03\">General Provisions.</E>\n                     (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n                </FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or</FP>\n                <FP SOURCE=\"FP1\">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</FP>\n                <P>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>\n                <PRTPAGE P=\"9584\"/>\n                <P>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</P>\n                <GPH SPAN=\"1\" DEEP=\"80\" HTYPE=\"RIGHT\">\n                    <GID>Trump.EPS</GID>\n                </GPH>\n                <PSIG>\u00e2\u0080\u0083</PSIG>\n                <PLACE>THE WHITE HOUSE,</PLACE>\n                <DATE>February 10, 2025.</DATE>\n                <FRDOC>[FR Doc. 2025-02734 </FRDOC>\n                <FILED>Filed 2-13-25; 8:45 am]</FILED>\n                <BILCOD>Billing code 3395-F4-P</BILCOD>\n            </EXECORD>\n        </PRESDOCU>"
