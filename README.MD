# Azure AI Agents Playground ðŸš€

**Welcome!** ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal playground repository dedicated to exploring the exciting world of **Azure AI Agents**!

**My Goal:**

As [Farzad528](https://github.com/farzad528), I'm on a journey to learn and build with Azure AI Agents. This repository serves as my lab to experiment with various aspects, including:

*   **Tutorials & How-To Guides:**  Step-by-step guides and explanations to help you get started with Azure AI Agents. Expect to see these in the form of well-documented **Jupyter Notebooks** and more.
*   **Random Projects & Experiments:**  Exploring different functionalities and use cases of Azure AI Agents through various coding experiments.
*   **Full-Stack Applications:**  Taking some of these experiments further by packaging them into complete, interactive applications using frameworks like **Chainlit**, **Gradio**, and potentially others.

**What to Expect:**

*   **Hands-on Examples:**  This repository will be filled with practical, hands-on examples that you can run and experiment with yourself.
*   **Focus on Azure AI Agents:** The primary focus is on leveraging the power of Azure AI Agents and related Azure AI services.
*   **Learning in Public:**  This is a learning journey, so expect to see works in progress, experiments, and evolving projects.
*   **Community Inspiration:** While primarily a personal playground, the goal is to create a valuable resource for the community to learn from and get inspired by.

**Technologies & Tools:**

*   **Azure AI Agents**
*   **Azure AI Services (like Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, etc.)**
*   **Python**
*   **Jupyter Notebooks**
*   **Chainlit**
*   **Gradio**
*   **[Potentially other relevant frameworks and libraries]**

**Get Started:**

1.  **Explore the Repository:** Browse the folders and files to see the different projects and tutorials as they are added.
2.  **Check out the Issues:**  See if there are any open issues or suggestions and feel free to contribute your thoughts.
3.  **Stay Tuned!** This repository will be continuously updated with new content as I explore and build with Azure AI Agents.

**Let's learn and build together in the world of Azure AI Agents!** ðŸ¤– âœ¨
